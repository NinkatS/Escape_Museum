VR Art Museum-Themed Escape Room with Hand Tracking
“Masterpiece Mystery: A Hand-Tracked Escape Room Adventure”
Sojung Shin
1. Objective:
To develop a VR escape room experience set in an art museum, where players must solve puzzles by interacting with various pieces of artwork. The game will heavily utilize hand-tracking functionality, allowing players to manipulate objects, engage in physical interactions, and unlock clues, ultimately leading to the escape.
 
2. Project Concept:
Masterpiece Mystery is a unique puzzle-solving experience that blends the immersive atmosphere of an art museum with the excitement of an escape room. The core gameplay revolves around solving puzzles by using hand gestures, object manipulation, and interactions with virtual sculptures, paintings, and other art pieces. By solving creative and tactile puzzles, players can unlock secrets and progress through the game.
Core Features:
1.	Interactive Museum Artworks:
o	The virtual environment replicates a sophisticated art museum, filled with paintings, sculptures, and interactive exhibits. Players use hand tracking to lift, touch, and manipulate these objects to solve puzzles.
2.	Transparent Glass Lid Mechanism:
o	At the center of the exhibition, a transparent glass lid covers a button. Players must physically lift the glass lid using hand tracking and press the button to reveal a large jewel.
3.	Artwork Interaction:
o	Players can give the jewel to a painting of a wealthy figure wearing luxurious items. This interaction rewards them with color paints, which they will use in the next puzzle.
4.	Drawing Puzzle:
o	With the paints, players will create a drawing on an empty canvas exhibited in the museum. Using hand-tracking gestures, they will select colors and paint directly on the virtual canvas.
o	Completing the painting will trigger the appearance of a hidden hand sculpture next to the canvas.
5.	Hand Sculpture Interaction:
o	The final challenge requires players to interact with the hand sculpture by shaking hands. The hand-tracking technology will detect this motion and reward the player with a key to exit.
o	Extension Option: In this phase, players must win a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the hand sculpture using hand gestures to receive the key.
6.	Exit Puzzle:
o	After successfully completing the final challenge, players will unlock the door to the next level or exit the game.
 
3. Hand-Tracking Functionality:
The core gameplay relies heavily on hand-tracking, ensuring that players must use natural gestures to progress. This will include:
•	Grabbing and lifting objects (e.g., glass lid)
•	Pressing virtual buttons
•	Transferring items between scenes (e.g., placing a jewel in a painting)
•	Drawing with hand (hand painting)
•	Complex hand gestures like shaking hands and playing rock-scissors-paper with a virtual hand sculpture
•	Precise object manipulation to enhance puzzle-solving
 
4. Game Mechanics:
•	Puzzle Solving: The game features a series of art-related puzzles that can only be solved by manipulating objects using hand-tracking. Players must observe the environment carefully, as every artwork and exhibit may hide a clue.
•	Interactive Environment: Players interact with paintings, sculptures, and display cases, each one contributing to the narrative and puzzle-solving process. The goal is to find a way to unlock the door to the next level or exit the museum.
•	Hand-Sculpture Interaction: At the final stage, players shake hands or engage in rock-scissors-paper with a hand sculpture to unlock the next stage, putting the hand-tracking technology to creative use.
 
5. Art and Level Design:
The game is set in a high-fidelity virtual art museum, featuring visually striking exhibits. Each level will have a distinct theme, with the initial room focused on classical art and sculptures. Future expansions can introduce different themes (e.g., modern art, surrealism) with corresponding puzzles.
 
6. Target Audience:
The game will appeal to VR enthusiasts, puzzle lovers, and escape room fans. The hand-tracking functionality offers a unique twist, providing an engaging and immersive experience. Casual gamers and fans of innovative VR interaction mechanics will also enjoy the intuitive nature of the hand-tracked controls.
 
7. Potential Extensions:
•	Rock, Paper, Scissors: Requires higher techniques because the program has to recognize which action did the player take of rock, paper and scissors from the player’s hand shape, at the exact time. 
•	Collaborative Mode: Introduce multiplayer interactions where players have to collaborate on advanced tasks, like communicating with the information they could get from the seperated different room they are in, emphasizing synchronized hand movements.
